# Exercise 3: Word Frequency #

## Included Files: ##
- freq.py
    - Cotains the functionality required by assignment


## Accessories: ##
    - None


## Wiring Instructions: ## 
    - None


## Running Instructions: ##

To anaylze word frequency in a file:
    In a command line enter:
    `python3 freq.py <File-to-analyze>`


## Notes and Assumptions ##

This Program uses the following modules:
    - sys -> Used to read cmd line arguments and to exit

### Notes on the solution: ###

The program will overwrite the contents of the following file:
    `<File-to-analyze>.out`
where <File-to-analyze> is the cmd line arg used when running the program

When openning a file, I used the `with` keyword since it automatically closes
the file upon leaving the `with` block. 
Since there is not a try...except block when opening file:
  - Program assumes input file exists. 

An exit value of `1` is returned when program fails due to invalid amount of
command line arguments.
