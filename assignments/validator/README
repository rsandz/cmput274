# Exercise 1: Password Validator and Generator #

## Included Files: ##
- validator.py
    - Cotains the functions required by assignment


## Accessories: ##
    - None


## Wiring Instructions: ## 
    - None


## Running Instructions: ##

First import `validator.py` into a python script.

To validate a password:
    - Call `validate(pass)`, where pass is the password you want to validate.

To generate a password:
    - Call `generate(n)`, where n is the length of the password you would like to generate


## Notes and Assumptions ##

This Program uses the following modules:
    - random -> Used in the generate password function
    - re -> Used in validation
    - string -> Used in generate Password function

### Notes on the solution: ###

A "MIN_LENGTH" constant was defined (Default: 8) as a global variable as to prevent hardcoding of the min password length

Regex Patterns were used in determining the validity of the password.
The reason for this is that it is more flexible and maintainable than using several `for in` loops. At the same
time, it is also less complex.
...Also, I wanted to play around with regular expressions!

The generate function will raise an error if the "n" argument provided is less than the MIN_LENGTH Constant

Happy Grading!
