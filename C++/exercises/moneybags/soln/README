# Description:
    - Use to calculate Dr. Moneybag's club threshold as per the 
        assignment instructions located on eclass.


# Running Instructions:
    Note: Anything located within `...` means to run it in the terminal.

    Standalone Use:
    - Extract files into a directory and open a terminal in that directory.
    - Run `make` to compile the source into the executable `moneybags.out`
    - Run `./moneybags.out` or `make run` to start the program
    - Run `make clean` to remove the executable

    During Program Runtime:
    - Enter an integer defining the number of applicants.
    - Enter each of the aplicants net worth as an integer in millions,
        delimited by a space or a new line. (e.g `1` = 1 million, `10` = 10 million)
    - The threshold 'N' should be outputed last and the program should stop.

    The program can also be systematically tested if the method is similar to 
    that of the test center provided on eclass.
 
Assumptions and Notes:
    - Only Integers are entered. Unexpected behaviour will occur otherwise
    - All applicants must be entered or the program will not continue
    - Value of inputs do not exceed ranges provided in assignment instructions 
        provided in eclass. No overflow testing was done as a result.
    - Assumes similar testing as in test center. (i.e. Don't import it)
