# Exercise 2: Unfair Dice #

## Included Files: ##
- unfairDice.py
    - Cotains the functions required by assignment


## Accessories: ##
    - None


## Wiring Instructions: ## 
    - None


## Running Instructions: ##

First import `unfairDice.py` into a python script.

To get biased rolls:
    - Call `biased_rolls(prob_list, s, n)` where:
        - prob_list (list) the probability of rolling a side of a die where the index corresponds to the side. Sums to 1
        - s (int) seed for random
        - n (int) number of rolls to return
        - returns list

To print a histogram of the rolls:
    - Call `draw_histogram(m, rolls, width)` where:
        - m (int) number of sides on die (m >= 2)
        - rolls (int) List of rolls generated by above function or general list of rolls
        - width (int) Max length of the histogram in characters

## Notes and Assumptions ##

This Program uses the following modules:
    - random -> Used in generating psuedo-random/biased rolls

### Notes on the solution: ###

`_` Signifies a throw-away variable

Information on mapping the PRNG can be found within the code as comments.

Don't want to count the number of stars on the screen for the histogram? Set DEBUG to True

### Notes on parameter values ###

Assumes all parameter values valid as per exercise description.
Several value checks have been implemented to enforce the above and implied conditions (i.e. histogram width >= 0 ).
They will raise an error if failed.
Please not that not all value checks may have been implemented.

Here's a joke to help you while marking
    "!False          ..It's funny cause it's True"

Happy Grading!
