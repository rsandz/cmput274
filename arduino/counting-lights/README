# Exercise 5: Counting Lights #

## Description ##
Binary Counter using LEDs

## Included Files: ##
- counting.cpp
    - Cotains the functionality required by assignment
- Makefile
- README


## Accessories: ##
    - Arduino Mega Board (Recomended: With Breadboard)
    - 4x Red LED
    - 1x Green LEDs
    - 5x 560 Ohm Resistor (Green Blue Brown)
    - 2x Push Buttons


## Wiring Instructions: ## 
Note: "+ LEAD" is the loger lead on the LED. "- LEAD" is the shorter lead on the LED.
"Pin" refer to digital pins, unless otherwise stated.

### LEDS ###
1. Arduino Pin 9 <--> + LEAD | RED LED | - LEAD <--> 560 Ohm Resistor <--> Arduino GND
2. Arduino Pin 10 <--> + LEAD | RED LED | - LEAD <--> 560 Ohm Resistor <--> Arduino GND
3. Arduino Pin 11 <--> + LEAD | GREEN LED | - LEAD <--> 560 Ohm Resistor <--> Arduino GND
4. Arduino Pin 12 <--> + LEAD | RED LED | - LEAD <--> 560 Ohm Resistor <--> Arduino GND
5. Arduino Pin 13 <--> + LEAD | RED LED | - LEAD <--> 560 Ohm Resistor <--> Arduino GND

### Push Buttons ###
1. Arduino Pin 6 <--> Push Button (Increment) <--> Arduino GND
2. Arduino Pin 7 <--> Push Button (Decrement) <--> Arduino GND


## Running Instructions: ##
    - Wire up according to above and run the Makefile to upload to Arduino
    - Use push buttons to increment or decrement the counter


## Notes and Assumptions ##
Solution uses a variable to track the increments and decrements due to button presses.
The binary representation of this count is used to define the on/off states of 
their respective LEDs.

There is a serial.print in the main function. Uncomment this to print the count after a button press.

The lights initially start of at count 0 - All LEDs are off.

Happy Grading!
