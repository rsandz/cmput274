Due to budget cuts there are restrictions on the number of different
letters that are being allowed in phrases.  A list of "bad" letters
has been developed, consisting of the 6 least frequent letters in 
English, that is "vkjxqz".

A phrase is allowed to use at most 4 of the letters from the bad set,
ignoring case. If it does, it is classified as a bad phrase, and called
a "badgram". If it uses 4 or less, is classified as an OK phrase.

So for example:
    A quick fox jogs.
is ok, while
    Vick the quizmaster just left.
is not.

Write a script called badgram.py that reads a sequence of lines and outputs 
for each of the lines in the input whether the line is a badgram or not. For 
each input line, your program should produce a new line containing "BAD" if 
the input line is a badgram, otherwise it should produce a line
containing "OK".  Blank lines are simply ignored.

Input

The input consists of blank lines, or of lines containing some characters.
Blank input lines are to be IGNORED, and generate no output.

For example:
A quick fox jogs.

Vick the quizmaster just left.

Output

For each non-blank input line there should be an output line containing 
either "BAD" or "OK".

Output for example input above:

OK
BAD
