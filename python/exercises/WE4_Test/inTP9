Your Task #1: Full Preprocessing Write a program called preprocess.py that takes a space-separated line of words as input and performs the following preprocessing steps in the order in which they are listed below. Unfortunately, lemmatization, stemming, and tagging of parts of speech are all too complex for this exercise, but you are expected to implement all the others. For each word: 1. Convert to lowercase. 2. Remove all punctuation and symbols. For our purposes, this includes any non-alphanumeric character. 3. Remove all numbers UNLESS the token consists only of numbers. So, for example, “4real” would become “real”, but “2018” would remain “2018”. 4. If the word is a stopword (see the list below), remove it. 5. If the word has not been completely removed by steps 1-4, add it to a list of processed words. When you have finished the processing steps, print the new text to the screen as a space- separated string. You must use the input function to read in the text, and output the processed text using print. Your program should print no other information to the terminal. This means that you should not have any input prompt or any additional print formatting. For the purposes of this program, here is the list of stopwords (you can find this list in plain text on eClass here): ["i", "me", "my", "myself", "we", "our", "ours", "ourselves", "you", "your", "yours", "yourself", "yourselves", "he", "him", "his", "himself", "she", "her", "hers", "herself", "it", "its", "itself", "they", "them", "their", "theirs", "themselves", "what", "which","who", "whom", "this", "that", "these", "those", "am", "is", "are", "was", "were", "be","been", "being", "have", "has", "had", "having", "do", "does", "did", "doing", "a", "an","the", "and", "but", "if", "or", "because", "as", "until", "while", "of", "at", "by", "for", "with", "about", "against", "between", "into", "through", "during", "before", "after", "above", "below", "to", "from", "up", "down", "in", "out", "on", "off", "over", "under", "again", "further", "then", "once", "here", "there", "when", "where", "why", "how", "all", "any", "both", "each", "few", "more", "most", "other", "some", "such", "no", "nor", "not", "only", "own", "same", "so", "than", "too", "very", "s", "t", "can", "will", "just", "don", "should", "now"] Here are a few sample test cases: All of the following hould be given using standard input when the program is called using python3 preprocess.py. Input #1: Output #1: Explanation: Input #2: Output #2: Input #3: Output #3: Explanation: When the stopwords and punctuation are removed, only these two words remain. Notice that “1968!” becomes “1968” after removing punctuation.
