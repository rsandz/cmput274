# Exercise 4: Text Preprocessor #

# Description #

Preprocesses text into training data for machine learning.

## Included Files: ##
- preprocess.py
    - Cotains the functionality required by assignment


## Accessories: ##
    - None


## Wiring Instructions: ## 
    - None


## Running Instructions: ##

To preprocess a text:
    In a terminal, run:
        `python3 preprocess.py <mode>`
            - You will then be prompted to enter your text

The following <mode> are valid (Only 1 at a time):
    - "keep-digits" - Keeps digits
    - "keep-stops" - Keep Stop words
    - "keep-symbols" - Keep Non alphanumerics


## Notes and Assumptions ##

This Program uses the following modules:
    - sys 
    - re

### Notes on the solution: ###

Regex is used to find and replace invalid characters in words.
It's less complex looking than using for loops and can be edited to
match edge cases better.

There's a debug flag, but it does not do anything.
It's just there for future use.

An exit value of `1` is returned when program fails due to invalid 
command line arguments.
